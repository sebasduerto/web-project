        <h1>FEARED BY MANKIND,<br>DUE TO ITS ROLE<br>AS A FEROCIUS MARINE PREDATOR</h1>
        <p>Sharks are a group of cartilaginous fishes (i.e., without a bony skeleton) popularly known as sharks and<br>scientifically known as selachimorphs or selachimorphs (i.e., belonging to the superorder Selachimorpha).</p>

            <h2>IMPORTANCE</h2>
            <p>As top predators, sharks help maintain healthy marine ecosystems, including seagrass beds and coral reefs. Without predators, there is the potential for predation and competition for other species that ultimately affects species richness and abundance within an ecosystem.</p>
            <p>The removal of sharks can have cascading effects throughout the ecosystems they inhabit, resulting in devastating economic and ecological consequences. Protecting sharks and allowing their populations to replenish is essential to restoring the health of the oceans.</p>

            <ul id="charac">
                <li>They commonly occupy the role of predators in their various habitats.</li>
                <li>They are usually torpedo-shaped, with a powerful tail at the end and a set of three major fins: dorsal (on the animal's back), and two pectoral fins (on the animal's chest). In addition, it has three smaller fins: pelvic, anal and a second dorsal fin.</li>
                <li>Their bodies are composed of cartilage, except for their powerful jaws, which are filled with serrated triangular teeth. The mouth is under the snout, arched and half-open all the time, and the eyes are one on each side of the skull.</li>
                <li>They can be huge like the whale shark (18 meters long) or small like the pygmy shark (which fits in a human hand).</li>
                <li>They breathe through five to seven pairs of gills, located on the sides of the head. To do so, they must be in continuous movement, so that water penetrates through their mouths. Likewise, lacking a swim bladder, they must swim constantly or sink to the bottom of the sea.</li>
                <li>Their skin is usually rough, strong, made up of scales and designed to muffle the animal's movements, reducing friction with the water.</li>
                <li>The longevity of sharks does not exceed 30 years in most species, although some few can reach a hundred, thanks to the shark's formidable immune system, which is subject to study by scientists.</li>

                <h2>POWER SUPPLY</h2>
                <p>Sharks are mostly predators, so their diet is generally carnivorous, covering a very wide range of marine species: fish, marine mammals, mollusks, marine arthropods or even other sharks. It all depends on the size and habitat of the shark. They may also resort to eating carrion, depending on the case.</p>
                <p>However, three species of sharks (whale shark, basking shark, and porbeagle) feed instead through a water filtering mechanism, ingesting phytoplankton, nekton, algae and krill, as well as larvae, small crustaceans, squid or even small fish such as anchovies, sardines or certain types of tuna, thanks to specialized structures in their own gills.</p>
